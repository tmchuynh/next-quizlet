This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) - a conversion of my [Quizlet-Plus](https://github.com/tmchuynh/Quizlet-Plus) project into a Next.js project. It's a web-based quiz application designed to offer a variety of quizzes across multiple subjects, including Chemistry, History, Math, and more. The application supports user registration, tracks progress, and allows users to select quizzes based on

## Features

**User Registration and Login:**

-   Users register with first name, last name, email, username, and password. Users are shown a checklist of password requirements during registration and password reset, with real-time indicators for compliance (e.g., minimum length, inclusion of uppercase letters, etc.). Requirements are updated dynamically as users type, providing immediate feedback on password strength. Users login information is stored in `localStorage` and the user's ID is storaged in `sessionStorage` after login along with their first and last name for generating a dynamic welcome message.
-   Users can initiate a password reset process through a "Forgot Password?" link on the login page. This is mocked by using cookies instead of sending POST requests to the user's email address.
-   Upon accessing the confirmation code, users can enter a new password, which is validated against the established password requirements.
-   Users are notified of successful password changes, allowing them to log in with their new credentials immediately.

**Quiz Functionality:**

-   Users can take quizzes consisting of a series of questions tailored to different subjects and difficulty levels.
-   Questions are dynamically loaded based on the selected quiz and user progress.
-   Progress is visually represented through a progress bar, allowing users to track their completion status.
-   The application saves quiz progress in `localStorage`, allowing users to easily resume quizzes where they left off without losing their current state.
-   Users have the option to retry quizzes, which resets their current question index and score for a new attempt.

**Score Tracking:**

-   Scores are calculated at the end of each quiz and displayed alongside the total number of questions answered. Each quiz level button will display the user’s highest score, providing quick access to performance metrics. Users can easily see their best achievements at a glance, encouraging them to improve.
-   Scores are stored in `localStorage` for persistence across sessions, ensuring users can revisit their achievements.
-   Users can view a history of their past scores, including individual score details, total questions, and timestamps for reference.
-   Users have the ability to sort their past scores by date or score, providing flexibility in how they view their performance.
-   A reset functionality allows users to clear their past scores, giving them a fresh start whenever desired.

**Leaderboard:**

-   A leaderboard feature displays the top scores achieved by users, fostering a sense of competition and motivation.
-   Users can view their ranking based on scores across quizzes, along with the total number of quizzes taken.
-   The leaderboard updates dynamically as users complete quizzes, showcasing the highest scores and their respective usernames.
-   The application will include a consistent header and footer throughout the interface for improved navigation.
-   The header will feature quick links to different sections of the app, while the footer will contain copyright information and additional resources.

**Responsive UI:**

-   The application is designed with a flexible and responsive layout, ensuring a seamless experience across devices and screen sizes.
-   Clear error messages and visual indicators provide immediate feedback for form validation, enhancing usability.

**Accessibility Features:**

-   Input fields are highlighted with error indicators when validation fails, helping users identify issues easily.
-   User-friendly messages are displayed for success or error states, ensuring clarity in communication.

**Data Management:**

-   Efficient storage and retrieval of user scores and quiz progress utilize `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, enabling data persistence.
-   JSON-based data handling simplifies parsing and serialization, allowing for straightforward data manipulation.

**Confirmation Dialogs:**

-   Users receive confirmation prompts for critical actions, such as resetting scores or changing passwords, helping to prevent accidental changes.

**Real-time Feedback:**

-   The application provides instant feedback on user actions, including successful registrations, password resets, or validation errors, creating an engaging user experience.
